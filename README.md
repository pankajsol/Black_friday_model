# Black_friday_model
Black Friday is a superstore dataset, we have created a model on this dataset using decision tree and random forest technique to analyze the customer purchasing behavior. 
So after implementing both the algorithms we have find that decision tree algorithm is giving 65% accuracy whereas random forest algorithm is giving accuracy of 70% in both train and test.
Therefore, Random forest is better than decision tree algorithm.
